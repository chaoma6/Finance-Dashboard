# MERN Finance APP with Machine Learning Predictions

The MERN Finance Dashboard is an advanced financial analytics platform that enables users to explore data, gain insights, and make informed decisions. Using modern technologies like React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Material UI, and Recharts, it provides visually-rich data visualizations and predictive analytics. With a robust backend powered by Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, the platform ensures efficient API handling and seamless integration with external APIs. Overall, the MERN Finance Dashboard offers a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for financial data analysis and machine learning predictions.

## Backend Implementation

The backend of the MERN Finance Dashboard App is built using Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust and efficient server-side environment to handle API requests and interact with the MongoDB database. Here's an overview of the backend implementation:

1. **Set Up Server:**
   - The backend server is created using Express.js, a popular backend framework for Node.js applications.
   - The server is set up to listen for incoming HTTP requests on a specified port.

2. **Connect to MongoDB:**
   - The backend establishes a connection to the MongoDB database using the Mongoose library, which simplifies data modeling and interactions with the database.
   - The connection URL for the MongoDB database is configured in the environment variables.

3. **Define API Routes:**
   - The backend defines several API routes to handle various requests related to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), products, and transactions.
   - These API routes are responsible for fetching data from the MongoDB database and sending it back as responses to frontend requests.

4. **Implement Controllers:**
   - For each API route, corresponding controllers are implemented to handle the logic for processing the incoming requests and generating responses.
   - The controllers use Mongoose models to interact with the MongoDB database and retrieve the required data.

5. **Model Definitions:**
   - Mongoose models are defined for each data collection (KPI, product, transaction) to specify the data schema and validation rules.
   - The models define the structure of the data and allow for easy interaction with the database using predefined methods like find, create, update, etc.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - The backend includes error handling middleware to catch and handle any unexpected errors that may occur during the processing of API requests.
   - Appropriate error messages and status codes are sent as responses when errors are encountered.

7. **CORS Configuration:**
   - To allow cross-origin requests from the frontend application, the backend is configured to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
   - CORS headers are added to the server responses to allow requests from the frontend hosted on a different domain.

8. **API Documentation:**
   - The backend is well-documented, providing clear descriptions of the available API endpoints, their methods, and the expected responses.
   - The documentation assists frontend developers in understanding how to interact with the backend to retrieve the required financial data.

9. **Data Integration:**
   - The backend seamlessly integrates with external APIs like RAPID API and IMAGIN API to access additional car-related data and image manipulation capabilities.
   - The data from these APIs is processed and stored in the MongoDB database, making it available for frontend applications to use.

## Technologies Used

Frontend: Vite (Starter Application), React with Redux Toolkit (State Management), Material UI (Component Library), Recharts (Charts Library)

Backend: Node.js (Runtime), Express.js (Backend Framework)

Database: MongoDB
